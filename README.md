# **Egg-Sactly!!**
### *By team 13*
> Malnutrition is one of the most important reasons for child mortality in developing countries, especially during the first 5â€‰years of life. Malnutrition occurring in the world is caused by insufficient monitoring, identification, and assessment efforts. Therefore, interventions focusing on the identification and treatment of malnutrition are valuable, as they reduce the risks and rates of malnutrition. Technology may be a particularly useful ally in identifying malnutrition due to scalability, timeliness, and effectiveness.
